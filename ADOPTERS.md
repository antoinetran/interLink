### INFN

Project: Heterogeneous Resource integration for scientific workflows/pipelines

Used to enable a seamless provisioning of heterogeneous resources to k8s-based workload manager. interLink grant the possibility to offload the execution of parts of the workload to external providers serving suitable hardware. Leveraging the capability to provision any type of backend without customization on the user end, it makes transparent  the exploitation of HPC centers
